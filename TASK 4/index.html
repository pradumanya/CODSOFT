            lashes.</li>

        <li>Following this incident, he took the surname Azad and became known as Chandrashekhar Azad.</li>


        <h3>Revolutionary Activities of Chandra Shekhar Azad</h3>
        <li>Mahatma Gandhi suspended the Non-Cooperation movement in February 1922 as a result of the Chauri-Chaura
            incident, which was a blow to Azad's Nationalist sentiments.</li>

        <li>He then determined that a massive approach would be more effective in achieving his goal. </li>

        <li>During this time he met a lot of young Revolutionary Leaders of India. </li>

        <li>Ram Prasad Bismil, Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Sachindra Nath Sanyal, Shachindra Nath Bakshi, and Ashfaqulla
            Khan formed the Hindustan Republican Association in 1923.</li>

        <li>Chandra Shekhar Azad met Manmath Nath Gupta,
            a young revolutionary who introduced him to Ram Prasad Bismil, the founder of the Hindustan Republican
            Association (HRA),
            a revolutionary group.</li>

        <li>He then became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association and began fundraising for it.
            Robberies of government property are used to collect the rest of the funds.</li>

        <li>He was involved in the Kakori Train Robbery that happened in 1925. In the year 1928, he shot J.P.
            Saunders to take revenge of Lala Lajpat Rai’s murder in Lahore. Also, he had attempted to blow away India’s
            Viceroy’s train in 1929.</li>

        <li>The British clamped down on revolutionary movements
            in the wake of the Kakori train robbery in 1925.</li>


        <li>Prasad, Ashfaqulla Khan, Thakur Roshan Singh, and Rajendra Nath Lahiri were all found guilty and sentenced
            to death.</li>

        <li>Azad, Keshab Chakravarthy, and Murari Sharma managed to escape being apprehended. </li>

        <li>Later, with the aid of revolutionaries including Sheo Verma and Mahaveer Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad
            reorganized the HRA.</li>

        <li>Azad and Bhagat Singh secretly renamed the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) as the Hindustan Socialist
            Republican Association (HSRA) on September 9, 1928 to achieve their primary goal of a socialist-based
            independent India.</li>

        <li>For a time, Azad made Jhansi the headquarters of his HRA organisation. He practiced shooting in the forest
            of Orchha, 15 kilometers from Jhansi, and, as an expert marksman, he also taught other members of his tribe.
        </li>

        <li>For a long time, he lived in a hut near a Hanuman temple on the banks of the Satar River under the alias of
            Pandit Harishankar Bramhachari.</li>

        <li>He developed a good relationship with the local residents by teaching children from the nearby village of
            Dharampura.</li>

        <li>He learned to drive a car at the Bundelkhand Motor Garage in Sadar Bazar while living in Jhansi.</li>

        <li>Sadashivrao Malkapurkar, Vishwanath Vaishampayan, and Bhagwan Das Mahaur became close friends with him and
            joined his revolutionary party.</li>

        <li>Azad was also loyal to the then-congress leaders Raghunath Vinayak Dhulekar and Sitaram Bhaskar Bhagwat.
        </li>

        </li>He also stayed at Rudra Narayan Singh's house in Nai Basti and Bhagwat's house in Nagra for a while.</li>

        <li>Bundelkhand was one of his most devoted supporters. Dewan Kesri Shatrughan Singh, the father of the
            Bundelkhand freedom movement, aided Azad financially as well as with arms and fighters. Azad paid numerous
            visits to his fort in Mangrauth.</li>
        </li>

        <h3>Azad and Bhagat Singh</h3>
        The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) was created by Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Bismil, Sachindra Nath
        Bakshi, Sachindra Nath Sanyal in 1923. After the Kakori train robbery in 1925, the Britishers attempted to
        suppress revolutionaries. Ashfaqulla Khan, Prasad, Rajendra Nath Lahiri, and Thakur Roshan Singh were sentenced
        to death for their participation in the revolutionary activities.<br> <br>


        Murari Lal Gupta, Chakravarthy, Azad and Keshab evaded capture. With the help of revolutionaries like Mahavir
        Singh and Shiv Verma, Chandrashekhar Azad reorganized the association.<br> <br>


        Azad along with Bhagat Singh and other revolutionaries secretly restructured the Hindustan Republican
        Association (HRA) in 1928 and renamed it the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) on 8-9 September
        in order to achieve their primary goal of an independent India based on the idea of socialism.<br> <br>


        The revolutionary activities of Azad are described by Manmath Nath Gupta, a member of HSRA in his multiple
        writings. Gupta has also dedicated a section in his book “History of the Indian Revolutionary Movement” to
        describe the works of Azad. He named this section “Chandrashekhar Azad”. <br> <br>


        <h3> Chandra Shekhar Azad Death </h3>
        <li>After being surrounded by police and finding no way out after the ammunition ran out, Chandra Shekhar Azad
            shot himself and died on 27 February 1931 at Alfred Park which is now famously known as Azad Park in
            Allahabad.</li>

        <li>After Veerbhadra Tiwari, their old companion who later turned traitor told them of his presence in the park,
            the police surrounded him.</li>

        <li>In the course of defending himself, he was wounded, and Sukhdev Raj killed three police officers and injured
            others. Sukhdev Raj was able to flee as a result of his actions.</li>

        <li>Without telling the general public, the body was taken to Rasulabad Ghat for cremation. People crowded the
            park where the incident occurred as soon as word got out. They chanted anti-British slogans and thanked
            Azad.</li>


        <h3>Chandrashekhar Azad Quotes</h3>
        Some of the famous Chandra Shekhar Azad slogans during the Indian Independence movement were as follows:<br>
        <br>

        <li>Aisi jawaani kisi kaam ki nahi jo apni matra bhoomi ke kaam na aa sake.</li>

        <li>Ab bhi jiska khoon na khaula khoon nahi wo pani hai, jo desh ke kaam na aaye woh bekar jawani hai (If yet
            your blood does not rage, then it is water that flows in your veins. For what is the flush of youth if it is
            not of service to the motherland).</li>

        <li>Don’t see others doing better than you, beat your own records every day because success is a fight between
            you and yourself.</li>

        <li>I believe in a religion that propagates freedom, equality and brotherhood.</li>

        <li>A plane is always safe on the ground, but it is not made for that. Always take some meaningful risks in life
            to achieve great heights.</li>

        In this biography of Chandrashekhar Azad, <br>we got to know about Chandrashekhar Azad's birthday, his
        education, career, his Revolutionary movement, and his death.


        <h3>Chandrashekhar Azad Legacy</h3>
        Many schools, roads, colleges, and other public institutes in India are named <br>after him. Starting from
        Jagdish Gautam's film Chandrashekhar Azad released in 1963 and Manoj Kumar's film Shaheed in 1965, many films
        have portrayed the character of Azad.<br> The Bollywood actor Manmohan portrayed Azad in a 1965 film,
        Sunny Deol played his character in the movie 23 March 1931: Shaheed.<br>
        Akhilendra Mishra also played Azad in the movie The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Raj Zutshi played Azad in the
        movie Shaheed-E-Azam. <br>
        In the film, Rang De Basanti directed and produced by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, Aamir Khan portrayed Azad.<br>
        <br>


        Jawaharlal Nehru writes in his autobiography that he met Azad a few weeks before his death, discussing the
        impact of the Gandhi-Irwin pact. Nehru saw the futility of Azad's methods and was not completely convinced by
        his peaceful methods.


        The lives of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Azad, and Ashfaq were depicted in the film Rang De Basanti released in 2006
        in which Aamir Khan portrayed Azad. The movie described the lives of these young revolutionaries so today's
        youth can take inspiration from them.<br>


        The 2018 television series Chandrashekhar displayed the journey of Chandrashekhar Azad from a young boy to a
        revolutionary leader. In this series, Ayaan Zubair portrayed the early life of Azad, Dev Joshi played Azad in
        his teens and Karan Sharma played adult Azad. <br>


        <h4>Conclusion </h4>
        Chandrashekhar Azad was known for his organizational abilities, and he was instrumental in the Hindustan
        Socialist Republican Association's reorganization. In either case, he desired full independence for India. To
        avenge Lala Lajpat Rai's murder, he assassinated British Assistant Superintendent of Police <br>
        John Poyantz Saunders. He became a wanted man as a
        result of his crimes,<br> but he was able to elude the
        cops for several years.<br> He was Bhagat Singh's mentor.
        One of his friends betrayed him, and the British police
        seized him. <br>He fought valiantly, but when he saw no other
        way out, he shot himself to keep his promise of not being
        captured alive.
